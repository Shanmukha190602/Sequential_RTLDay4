Flip-flop is a term that comes under digital electronics, and it is an electronic component that is used to store one single bit of information.



Since Flip Flop is a sequential circuit its input is based upon two parameters, one is the current input and the other is the output from the previous state.

It has two outputs, both are complements of each other.

It may be in one of two stable states, either 0 or 1.
